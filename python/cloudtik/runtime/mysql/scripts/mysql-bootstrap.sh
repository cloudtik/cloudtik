# TODO: For group replication, a few cases needs to be considered:
# 1. For the first time creating, the head node needs to execute start group replication
# with bootstrap.
# 2. For a full restart of the cluster, currently we can only handle the case that the head
# node is with the most up to date data. In this case, we do the same as the first time
# creating.
# 3. For head node failure and restart, other members are still in running. The head node
# don't need bootstrap. Instead it just join with running workers as seeds

# Instead of using group_replication_bootstrap_group=ON, it is safer to manually start
# group replication and turn on group_replication_bootstrap_group ON and OFF in commands.
