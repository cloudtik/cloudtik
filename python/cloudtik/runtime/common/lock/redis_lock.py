"""
Basically the random value is used in order to release the lock in a safe way,
with a script that tells Redis: remove the key only if it exists and the value
stored at the key is exactly the one I expect to be. 

if redis.call("get",KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
    return redis.call("del",KEYS[1])
else
    return 0
end

This is important in order to avoid removing a lock that was created by another
client. For example a client may acquire the lock, get blocked performing some
operation for longer than the lock validity time (the time at which the key will
expire), and later remove the lock, that was already acquired by some other client.
Using just DEL is not safe as a client may remove another client's lock.
