# Set the hosts and volumes MinIO uses at startup
# The command uses MinIO expansion notation {x...y} to denote a
# sequential series.
#
# The following example covers four MinIO hosts
# with 4 drives each at the specified hostname and drive locations.
# The command includes the port that each MinIO server listens on
# (default 9000)

MINIO_VOLUMES="{%minio.volumes%}"

# Set all MinIO server options
#
# The following explicitly sets the MinIO Console listen address to
# port 9001 on all network interfaces. The default behavior is dynamic
# port selection.

MINIO_OPTS="--address {%bind.ip%}:{%service.port%} --console-address {%bind.ip%}:{%console.port%}"

# MINIO_ROOT_USER and MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD sets the root account for the MinIO server.
# This user has unrestricted permissions to perform S3 and administrative API operations
# on any resource in the deployment.
# If not set, the default values are 'minioadmin:minioadmin'.

# Set the root username.
#
# Defer to your organizations requirements for superadmin user name.

MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin

# Set the root password
#
# Use a long, random, unique string that meets your organizations
# requirements for passwords.

MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin

# Set to the URL of the load balancer for the MinIO deployment
# This value *must* match across all MinIO servers. If you do
# not have a load balancer, set this value to to any *one* of the
# MinIO hosts in the deployment as a temporary measure.
# MINIO_SERVER_URL="https://minio.example.net:9000"
